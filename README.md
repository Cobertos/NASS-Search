NASS Search

A tool to search NHTSA's NASS database as well as export the data

SETUP:
1) pip install -r requirements.txt
2) Download the NASS database folders (the folders with the names of the years) from the FTP and put them in a folder
2b) Extract all the WinZip self-extracting archives in years that you would like to search (TODO: automatically do this)
3) Configure preferences in nassGlobal.py (including where the NASS databases are stored)
4) You can now run nass.py
