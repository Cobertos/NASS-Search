* Add options to both nass and nassPreprocess eventually

nassSearchTerm
hide more functionality of resolve in the term! (return a control object instead of calling the function itself, also pass the type of term with the mapFunc)

USER INTERFACE
* Pointer-options fix for <IE11
* User friendly names (partial support on backend for this already with translateObj, just implement it everywhere)
* Delete should select next available term
* Styling on the go button alert box
* Split up the cases into multiple ajax calls based on when the user wants more
